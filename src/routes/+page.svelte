		<h2>Why?</h2>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The reason I choose to become an engineer hasn't changed: I have an insatiable love of learning, and computer science is such a vast field. There is so much to do, and programming in particular satisfies a number of my core needs: with the problem-solving it requires, the pattern recognition is necessitates, the freedom to create it grants, and the self-expression it thus grants. There's no right way to do computer science. I focus on web design and accessibility, but just as easily, one could focus on embedded systems, databasing, cybersecurity, data science, programming language design, machine learning, operating systems, graphics…</p>
			<p>The options are innumerable, and new fields continue to emerge. I will never go hungry, and being an engineer means being surrounded by like-minded people with the same love of learning. Plus, I get to pick up bits and pieces from every new person I interact with, as well :-)</p>
